This is a collection of tools I am developing for the purpose of assistance in developing pit stop strategies during endurance races in the simulator Assetto Corsa
This repository currently consists of code for scraping data from the Assetto Hosting web platform and a dashboard that outputs pit stop strategies under safety car and full course yellow on demand.
Interoperability between these applications, along with integration with Assetto Corsa itself, is planned in the future.

Current dependencies:

Dashboard:

pyqt5

Web Scraping:

selenium

Firefox (the source code can be modified to accomodate Chrome or Firefox)

Note: This project is not affiliated with Assetto Corsa or its developers.
